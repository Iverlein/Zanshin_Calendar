# Zanshin Calendar — Roadmap

Planned work that is not yet built. [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) describes what the app
does; this file describes what it is meant to do next. When an item is built,
its settled design moves into the SPEC and the entry here is removed.

The rules of the SPEC apply to everything below: no text without a published
source (§8), nothing the app cannot calculate, no `INTERNET` permission (§2).

## By effort

The items below, easiest first. Sizes: **S** a sitting, one or two files;
**M** a few days, new code with its tests; **L** a week or more, touching
most screens or needing a generator in `tools/`; **XL** several weeks,
mostly research or design before any code. The rank counts the work of
building an item, not its prerequisites; "Needs" gives those, so the build
order can differ from the rank. An item with no use on its own is ranked
with the one that gives it a use. "Later" is not ranked.

| # | Item | Size | Why | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | T3 Element colours | S | A colour per element, once it has a place | A place for the day's element on the page (sourced: Berzin 3) |
| 2 | L4 Hosted Weblate | S | The repository is ready (docs/weblate.md); the project, its three components and the review rules are set up on Weblate with the owner's account; the translating itself is outside the code and open-ended | Not before 2026-12-28 (three months of development, for the Libre plan) |
| 3 | L3 Russian | S | Translated and passing `CatalogTest`, with the store listing and the language switch; what is left is the owner's read-through on the phone and the fixes it brings | — |
| 4 | T2 Tibetan readings | M | Mansions, the activity lists (doubled mansions read on the print), lunar dates, weekdays, yogas, karaṇas, the trigram, the combinations of weekday and mansion, the special days, Rāhu's course and the earth lords are built, and the day is weighed by the texts' rank; the print's other activity boxes are read and built (50 lists); the hour-level factors and the rest of WB ch. 31 are left ([sources/](sources/README.md)) | Reading the *kun phan me long* tables for more activities |
| 5 | T4 Element calculation, with the T5 settings | XL | Progressions that differ by gender, obstacle years and yearly sme ba, each needing a vector; the readings of every result need sources. Mo is not planned. The gender setting is small but nothing reads it before T4, so it ships with it | — |
| 6 | M1 Meditation Timer and Bell | M | Requested feature: meditation timer and randomized periodic bell (MindBell functionality) | Port audio/alarm logic from MindBell, build Compose UI |

## Tibetan page

### T2. Meaning of the components and day details

Built: the lunar mansion's reading and Henning's thirteen activity lists
(SPEC §5.10), with his doubled mansions read on the *kun phan me long*
print; the White Beryl's readings of the lunar date, the weekday, the
yoga, the karaṇa and the trigram (the eight goddesses of the date, SPEC
§5.11); the Tibetan day weighed as the *kun phan me long* says (SPEC §5.12),
the page in its rank, the day in brief deciding each activity by the
strongest factor and the day's tone by the combinations of weekday and
mansion (the 28 named ones and the element pairs), then the special days,
then the side with more factors, the *Rdo rje gtsug lag*'s special days
(WB p. 337) among them; Rāhu's course by date and over the hours of a day;
Jupiter's nectar periods (KP §10); the personal
mansions (SPEC §5.8); the *kun phan me long*'s other activity boxes
([kp-activities.md](sources/kp-activities.md)); WB ch. 31's earth lords of the lunar date's animal
(SPEC §5.11). The texts are in
[sources/](sources/README.md), with a plan for what is still to be read
([sources/PLAN.md](sources/PLAN.md)). Left:

- **The hour-level factors** (SPEC §5.13): the combination period
  (*tatkāla dus sbyor*, KP §9), which the text holds above everything and
  which needs the five planets; Rāhu's course by year and month.
- **The rest of WB ch. 31** ([earth-lords.md](sources/earth-lords.md)): the
  *bla mkhyen* of the day (it needs the day's sme ba, which WB starts at 1
  on the winter solstice without saying which way it counts: question 11).
  The day by the clan's element (*rus chen*, p. 225) is not planned: it
  needs a Tibetan patrilineal clan, which the app's readers do not have, and
  WB itself confines it to reckoning for the dead.
- **Open readings** for a reader of the tradition
  ([open-questions.md](sources/open-questions.md)): the yoga ranking (1),
  SY's Mouse *gshed gza'* (5), the offerings box's khrums smad (6), sha
  'khon's short reading (8), 'Od 'bar ma's *chu gri bkar* (10) and the
  direction of the day's sme ba (11).

### T3. Element colours

The sme ba shows in the colour of its box (SPEC §10.3), the four aspects
with the pebbles of the year, month, day and hours are built (SPEC §5.9),
and so are the personal mansions (SPEC §5.8). What is left waits on design:

- **Element colours:** wood green, fire red, earth yellow, iron white, water
  black or blue (Berzin 3). The day's element appears only inside the day
  line, so it first needs a place of its own on the page.
- Whole days stay uncoloured, as on the 旧暦 page (SPEC §10.4). The element
  pair already marks four of its ten pairs as inauspicious.

### T4. Divination

- **Element calculation ('byung rtsis)** is arithmetic: birth animal and
  element, sme ba and spar kha of year and day (the day's already computed,
  Janson E.9–E.11), progressed animal, element and sme ba for each year of
  age (Berzin 3, 4; they differ for men and women, so they need a gender
  setting, see T5), obstacle years (keg). The yearly sme ba appears to follow the
  same count as the 九星 year star (1 at a wood-rat year, counting down), so
  it can share code with the 九星 year star (SPEC §7.5) once a vector confirms it. The readings of each
  result need sources; the calculated positions do not.
- **Mo** (Mipham's dice: two throws of the ARAPACANA die, 36 outcomes; other
  systems use three dice or a mala) has no calculation beyond a random draw.
  Every reading is a text, and the English ones are copyrighted
  translations (Goldberg, *Mo*, Snow Lion 1990). Berzin notes it is done in
  a meditational context after a retreat. Not planned.

### T5. Personal settings

Built together with T4: nothing else reads the gender.

Birth date and gender sit together in one "Personal" section of the menu,
since every personal reading needs one or both: the personal days of both
calendars and the nine-star reading need the birth date; the progressions of T4 need both.

- Gender: not set, male or female; the tradition defines the progressions
  for these two only. While it is not set, the readings that need it are
  hidden rather than guessed.
- Both stay on the device only, as the birth date does now (SPEC §10.5).

### M1. Meditation Timer and Periodic Bell

Porting the core functionality of the open-source MindBell app into Zanshin Calendar using modern Android architecture (idiomatic Kotlin, Jetpack Compose).

- **Meditation Timer**: A countdown UI built in Compose. Will use a Foreground Service with a persistent notification to ensure the timer finishes reliably without being killed by modern Android battery optimization.
- **Periodically Sounding Bell**: A background chime that rings at either fixed intervals or randomized intervals (matching MindBell's original functions, ringing within an active daytime window).
- **Audio**: Needs a bundled bell sound (e.g., OGG/MP3) with an F-Droid compatible free license (such as Apache 2.0 or CC0).
- **Implementation**: Avoids the deprecated MindBell background service patterns. Uses modern `AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle()` (or equivalent WorkManager scheduling) with a `BroadcastReceiver` to handle audio playback efficiently. Must maintain the strict `No INTERNET` policy.

## Localisation

English stays the source language. The order: Russian, translated by the
project; then Japanese; then German, French, Spanish, Portuguese and
Chinese (Simplified and Traditional, served separately), all through Hosted
Weblate.

The text is out of the code: interface text in `strings.xml`, the engines'
and readings' text in the catalog, dates and ordinals by the app's language
(SPEC §8.2, §10.1). A language is added as files, not code.

### L3. Russian, by the project

Built: the interface strings, the catalog and the ru-RU store listing, with
the language switch in the menu (SPEC §8.2, §10.5).

- Done when the owner has read the app in Russian on the phone and the
  fixes that brings are in.

### L4. Hosted Weblate

For Japanese first, then German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Simplified
Chinese and Traditional Chinese.

The repository is ready: partial translations fall back to English string
by string, tests guard keys, placeholders, `locale_tag` and the
completeness of offered languages, and [weblate.md](weblate.md) gives every
setting of the project and its three components. What is left is on
Weblate and GitHub, with the owner's accounts:

- Push `main`; create the project on Hosted Weblate (Libre plan) and its
  components as in weblate.md; approve the imported Russian strings; add
  the GitHub webhook.
- Not before 2026-12-28: the Libre plan wants three months of active
  development, and development began on 2026-09-28 (weblate.md,
  *Eligibility*). The README then names Weblate.
- Split the catalog: the Wikipedia-adapted readings into a CC BY-SA
  component of their own (weblate.md, *The catalog's licence*).
- Fill the glossary with the kanji and Tibetan terms and their English.
- Japanese goes right after Russian, as the first Weblate language,
  translated there by the owner together with invited friends; the owner
  and those of them who read Japanese well are its reviewers. Its
  readings of the 旧暦 page can be written from the Japanese sources
  directly, but Todan's copyrighted wording still may not be copied;
  Wikipedia's CC BY-SA wording may, with attribution.
- The app itself gains no network access: translations arrive in the source
  and ship with a release.

## Later

- **Fortune-telling page** (九星気学 in full): 本命星, 月命星, the year, month
  and day boards, lucky directions and the 五黄殺, 暗剣殺, 本命殺 and 的殺
  directions. All of these can be calculated from the boards; the readings need
  sources. Only calculated positions, never free interpretation.
- Kyūreki: 神吉日, 凶会日, 五墓日, 時下食; 七十二候 (SPEC §3).
- Tibetan: Tsurphu version; Rishi-star bathing week (SPEC §3).
- Moon rise and set; notifications (SPEC §3).
- The widget: sizes and content (SPEC §10.6).
